    "Features have information on aspects of structure's location and construction. For instance, three distinct `geo_level_id`'s (1,2, and 3 respectively) represent the district, municipality/VDC and ward location of the surveyed structure. `foundation_type`, `roof_type`, `has_superstructure_mud`, and many others like these give us information on different aspects of the building's construction. Some features are continuous, for example age, height percentage, etc., but most are categorical. Among the categorical ones, most are dummies, some have a few categories encoded with strings, and a few like `geo_level_2_id` and `geo_level_3_id` have way too many categories (more than 100) inside them. These different cases need to be handled accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some of the categorical varaibles, it is not clear what the encoded characters representing different levels of the categorical variable really mean in the physical context of the structure. We were able to find the original dataset from which the data for this competition has most likely been subsampled. From that, we have gotten some more information on what different levels in each category could possiblly mean; however, we have not yet fully worked out what the character-encoded levels in some of our categorical variables exactly mean in the physical context."
